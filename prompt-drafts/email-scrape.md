I have created a new branch (`email-scrape`) in which I would like you to develop a new feature. \nContext: The Aquarium Drunkard website has gone behind a paywall, so the established scraping framework will no longer work. However, they still send out a weekly email that contains the same playlist that we were scraping before. I want you to refactor the webscraping portion of `ad_radio_playlist.py` to scrape the email instead of the aquarium drunkard website. The rough outline of the procedure should be the following:

1. access the email account that receives the newsletter (squeeeze.cheeeze@gmail.com), 
2. search the inbox for emails coming from the correct sender (aquariumdrunkard@96110637.mailchimpapp.com)
3. starting with the most recent email, search for the section on the "Aquarium Drunkard Show". This typically consists of an image, a title, and a text block consisting of two parts. The first section is a description of the program followed by the track list.
4. Parse the track list. The track list begins with "SIRIUS" then the show number followed by a colon, after which the song list begins. The format of the song list is `[Artist] – [Track] ++ [Artist] – [Track]` repeated an arbitrary number of times. There may or may not be an intro or outro at the beginning or end (usually labeled "Intro" or "Outro"). You could potential best identify songs by looking for ` – ` delimiters and parsing artists and tracks from either side of the delimiter. I have copied the html table row containing this section below from an example email. Do note however that the formatting as pasted may not be exactly the same as what is found when scraping the email body.

The track list should be constructed in the same format as `entries` in `ad_radio_playlist.py`, so that it can be looped over in the same way as is currently being done in the `update_playlist()` playlist function.

I have set up the Gmail API for this project and added a client id, client secret, access token, and refresh token to the `.env` file. All Gmail variables have a `GMAIL_` prefix. Please use the Gmail API to do the email scraping. I have installed the `google-auth-oauthlib` library into the virtual environment already. Please include any other gmail api helper libraries you need.
